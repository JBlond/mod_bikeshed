mod_bikeshed
============
What mod_bikeshed does is allow the server's Administrator to change the server signature/tokens to anything they want and will show up in the Server: header as well. You can also turn tokens off completely by setting BikeShedTokensString to "None".

Why the name mod_bikeshed?
It came from this mailing list thread discussing allowing the manipulations or removal of ServerTokens;
